    <h4>Goal of the project</h4>
    With the birth of my son, my passion for dinosaurs and their relatives flared up again.
    I was missing a simple overview including the timeline and inheritance of dinosaurs. So I did it myself.

    <h4>Implementation</h4>
    This project started as an exercise with the canvas. But then it quickly got out of hand and became the version that is now available.

    Most of the work has gone into gathering the data. I had to laboriously collect these from many sources (especially Wikipedia in different languages) and write them into a large JSON file.
    For this purpose I wrote a backend that makes the work easier or even possible.

    <h4>Contact</h4>
    I'm asking you to refrain from pointing out false parentage information, as these are presented differently in different sources.
    Also, I'm just a single person who can't put all of my time into maintaining this project.
    I can best be reached via the email address post@bitschmiede.com.
